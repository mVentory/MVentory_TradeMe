##Stability

This extension has been used by our customers for more than a year, but we only released it to the public in July 2014. Please, treat it as a beta version and feel free to report any problems to info@mventory.com.

##Dependencies

Note, this extension requires installation of our [Magento Mobile API extension](https://github.com/mVentory/MVentory_API), but you do not have to use the [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mageventory) for it. We are working on removing this cross dependency.

##About the extension

This extension was developed to support our combined PoS, Inventory and Website control app for Android to bring Magento closer to the realities of a retail business. We took several unconventional approaches to make the product listing process as quick and simple to the end user as possible. On the other hand we moved most of the essential admin tasks into an Android app, including listing on TradeMe.

##Help and support

The extension is poorly documented. We are working on it.

Please, contact us on info@mventory.com if you need help installing and configuring it.
