MVentory_TradeMe
============

[TradeMe](http://trademe.co.nz) is the leading New Zealand online auction site. This extension integrates Magento directly into TradeMe.


##Features


1. List a Magento product via an [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mageventory) ([source code repository](https://github.com/mVentory/app))

2. Configure automated rule-based listing of Magento products on TradeMe

3. Automatically sync TradeMe sales to update Magento inventory

4. Automatically withdraw an auction if a product goes out of stock while being listed on TradeMe

This extension has been used by our customers for more than a year, but we only now released it to the public via Magento connect and treat it as a beta version.

Note, this extension requires installation of our [Magento Mobile API extension](https://github.com/mVentory/MVentory_API), but you do not have to use the Android app for it. We are working on removing this cross dependency.

Please, contact us on info@mventory.com if you need help installing and configuring it.
