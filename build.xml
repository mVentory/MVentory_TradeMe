Stability



This extension has been used by our customers for more than a year, but we only released it to the public in July 2014. Please, treat it as a beta version and feel free to report any problems to info@mventory.com



Dependencies



Note, this extension requires installation of our Mobile API extension for Magento (http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/mobile-pos-inventory-barcode-scanning-photos-and-more-on-android.html), but you do not have to use the Android app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mageventory) that comes with it.

About the extension



This extension was developed to support our combined PoS, Inventory and Website control app for Android to bring Magento closer to the realities of a retail / warehousing business. We took several unconventional approaches to make the product listing process as quick and simple to the end user as possible. On the other hand we moved most of the essential admin tasks into an Android app, including listing on TradeMe.
